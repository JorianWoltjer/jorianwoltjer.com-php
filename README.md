Personal Website, with information and a blog. All written in PHP.

> **Warning**: This repository is more meant as a reference and history, as opposed to a ready-to-go template. There are many bugs and quirks that I can handle because I know exactly how it works, but I do not want others to face the same issues. This is also the reason there is no database schema
